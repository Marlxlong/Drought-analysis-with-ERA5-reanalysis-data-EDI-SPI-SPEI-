# Drought-analysis-with-ERA5-reanalysis-data-EDI-SPI-SPEI-

Three drought indices implemented in Python language.

The calculation of SPI and SPEI indices relies on the Geographic and Meteorological Analysis (gma) library, which is a Python-based package for rapid processing, analysis, and visualization of geographic and meteorological data. The development process of gma draws inspiration from the operational logic and features of ArcGIS and QGIS, incorporating many original and unique functionalities. 

Overall, gma adheres to the principles of usability, openness, and efficiency enhancement. It continuously integrates excellent, cutting-edge, and widely demanded geographic/meteorological modeling algorithms, aiming to create a distinctive set of functions for geographic data processing and analysis, meteorological index calculation, and spatial mapping. With simple usage, comprehensive documentation, and typical examples, gma enables users to quickly grasp its functionalities and address real-world problems.

The construction of gma relies on libraries such as gdal 3.4.1+, numpy 1.23.3+, pandas 1.4.2+, scipy 1.7.3+, and matplotlib 3.5.2+, which are the foundation for the functionality provided by gma. To ensure the complete installation of gdal, it is recommended to download the compiled version of the corresponding whl package and install it manually on Windows.


The gma has been released to PyPI. You can install it by entering the following command in the terminal: pip install gma
